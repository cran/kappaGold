\description{
N = 30 patients were given one of k = 5 diagnoses by some n = 6
psychiatrists out of 43 psychiatrists in total. The diagnoses are
\enumerate{
\item Depression
\item PD (=Personality Disorder)
\item Schizophrenia
\item Neurosis
\item Other
}
}
\details{
A total of 43 psychiatrists provided diagnoses. In the actual
study (Sandifer, Hordern, Timbury, & Green, 1968), between 6 and 10
psychiatrists from the pool of 43 were unsystematically selected to diagnose
a subject. Fleiss randomly selected six diagnoses per subject to bring the
number of assignments per patient down to a constant of six.

As there is not a fixed set of six raters the ratings from the same column
are not related to each other. Therefore, compared to the dataset with the
same name in package \code{irr}, we applied a permutation of the six ratings.
